## Query Suggestion
### 1. Intoduction
This a query auto-completion system can be used in any searching scenario.I found query suggestion is an useful application in project,but there was 
no more documents or codes ,so I want to rebuild this project, andd make it more light and easy to use, and support different interface.

### 2. Algorithms and Model

### 3. Usage

### 4. Contact

### 5. Roadmap
~~ - 1. Combine normalization module in include/segment/normalize.h and include/util/normalize.h ~~
~~ - 2. Add more unit test for normalization module ~~
- 1. Design the old algorithm system framwork.
- 2. Supply Python interface for old algorithm.
- 3. Collect algorithm papers and documents.
- 4. Choose one more effectient algorithm.
